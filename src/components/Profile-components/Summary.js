      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <br></br>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2018 majoring in Political Science with minors in Spanish and Philosophy.</p>
      <p>In 2019, I began working for a non-profit organization in Québec City called l'Arche Étoile, caring for persons with special need.</p>
      <p>I rediscovered programming through the Intro to JavaScript course on Codecademy and was hooked.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, I discovered Lighthouse Labs and their Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
      <p>I enrolled and graduated from the bootcamp in July 2020.</p>
